# Project Title

This is the project assignment for a position at the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland.

What this does is reads in a directory of files and will parse through them and remove the following:
- Stop words (list of words provided in a file)
- Non Alphabetical characters

After the removal of specified objects (see list above) it will then use a stemming algorithm to reduce all remaining words into their base form (See Contributing).
Once that is complete it will count the usages of the remaining words and print out the top 20 used words.
